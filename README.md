üçµ Momo Tea Franchise & Operations Platform

Project Overview
This is a full-stack web application developed for the Momo Tea franchise, serving as the core infrastructure for both brand promotion and vendor management. The platform is strategically designed to support aggressive franchise expansion by providing a professional face for investors and a robust, centralized operations system for franchisees.

Key Features
The website is segmented into two primary areas:

A. Marketing & Investor Portal (Frontend)

  The public-facing portal is focused on showcasing the investment opportunity and brand strength:

  - Investor Pitch Deck Integration: High-level promotional materials and data to attract potential investors.
  - Franchise Recruitment: Dedicated content detailing the benefits, costs, and support structure for new franchisees.
  - Brand Integrity: A visually appealing interface that reinforces the professional and modern image of the Momo Tea brand.

B. Operations Management System (OMS) (Backend & Secure Login)

  A powerful, secure area providing transparency and control over daily vendor activities:
  
  - Real-Time Income & Sales
      * Centralized dashboards displaying sales, income, and key performance indicators (KPIs) for each vendor location.
          + Ensures financial transparency for investors and allows instant performance evaluation for franchisees.
  - Stock & Inventory Control
      * Tracks raw material usage (tea leaves, pearls, syrup, etc.), maintains par levels, and generates low-stock alerts.
          + Reduces waste, prevents stock-outs, and standardizes ingredient costs across the entire franchise.
  - Staff & Absence Management
      * System for managing employee records, tracking attendance, logging absences, and monitoring shift coverage per vendor.
          + Streamlines HR processes, ensures fair scheduling, and provides accurate payroll data.
